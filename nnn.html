<section id="mot-intro">
  <h2>Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT)</h2>
  <p>This theory was proposed by Mulliken & Hund (years mentioned as 1935/1937 in class notes). According to the theory, atomic orbitals combine when they form chemical bonds to give molecular orbitals.</p>

  <h3>Main features of MOT</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Atomic orbitals of two atoms overlap to form new orbitals called molecular orbitals.</li>
    <li>Number of molecular orbitals formed will be the same as the number of A.O. overlapped.</li>
    <li>Two atomic orbitals after overlapping form molecular orbitals, that is: Antibonding molecular orbital (ABMO) and Bonding molecular orbital (BMO).</li>
    <li>Each molecular orbital and atomic orbital can accommodate two electrons with opposite spin.</li>
  </ol>

<section id="nematic">
  <h2>Nematic liquid crystal</h2>
  <p>Nematic comes from Greek word nemato meaning thread; thread-like structure in this crystal long.</p>
  <p>The molecular axes are parallel to each other, but molecules are not arranged in layers; they show topological defects.</p>
  <p>Due to molecular orientation they show optical property; when the light passes through nematic liquid crystal it produces a 90° shift in polarization of light which is extremely useful in LCD.</p>
</section>

<section id="smectic">
  <h2>Smectic liquid crystal</h2>
  <p>The smectic word comes from a Greek word which means soap; these crystals are found at lower temperature than nematic.</p>
  <p>They form well defined layers that can slide over one another like soap; the molecules are perpendicular to the plane; there is a small amount of positional order but orientational orders are fixed.</p>
</section>

<section id="cholesteric">
  <h2>Cholesteric liquid crystal</h2>
  <p>Some nematic liquid crystals show color effect under UV/PL light and are known as cholesteric liquid crystal; this type of liquid crystal is called C because it was observed for cholesteryl derivatives.</p>
  <p>The structure can be described as twisted nematic structure; each plane of molecules is twisted slightly in relation to the plane up or down.</p>

  <h3>Uses</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>These crystals consume very little electric power; hence they are used in digital displays like pocket calculators, smart watches; also used in skin temperature indicators.</li>
    <li>Signal display: traffic signal, petrol pump indicators.</li>
    <li>Image converter: large screen projector.</li>
    <li>Advertising display: boards.</li>
    <li>Analog display: D.P. machine, thermometer, etc.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section id="bond-order">
  <h2>Bond order</h2>
  <p>The stability of bond is expressed in terms of bond order which is defined as one half of the difference between the number of electrons in bonding molecular orbitals and antibonding molecular orbitals.</p>
  <div class="katex box">\[ \text{B.O.} = \frac{N_b - N_a}{2} \]</div>

  <h3>Significance of bond order</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A negative or zero value of bond order means the molecule is unstable and does not exist.</li>
    <li>A positive value of bond order indicates the molecule exists and is stable.</li>
  </ol>
  <div class="katex box">\[ \text{B.O.} \propto \text{stability} \propto \frac{1}{\text{bond length}} \]</div>

  <h3>Magnetic behaviour</h3>
  <p>Molecules with one or more unpaired electrons in molecular orbitals are paramagnetic; while molecules with all paired electrons in molecular orbitals are diamagnetic.</p>

<section id="fullerene-intro">
  <h2>Fullerene C60 — Allotropic</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>It is a polymorphic form of carbon. It consists of hollow spherical shell clusters of large number of carbon atoms in fullerenes; each group of carbon atoms are bonded to one another in the form of hexagon and pentagon; fullerenes are also called bucky balls (Buckminsterfullerene).</p>
  <p>The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto, and Richard Smalley; it is popularly known as buckminster fullerene whose structure resembles a geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller based on hexagons and pentagons.</p>
  <p>C60 consists of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons arranged such that no two pentagons share common edges.</p>

<section id="fullerene-prep">
  <h2>Fullerenes: preparation, properties, applications</h2>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <p>Fullerenes are prepared by vaporising a graphite rod in the atmosphere of helium; a mixture of fullerenes are formed which are separated by solvent extraction or sublimation method.</p>

  <h3>Properties</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Nucleus to nucleus diameter of fullerenes is approx. 0.7–1 nm and average bond length is ~1.4 Å.</li>
    <li>Pure fullerene is found to be insulator, but with doping of good electron donating ions (K) it can be conducting or even superconductor.</li>
    <li>C60 is an insulator but K3C60 (potassium fulgide/alkali intercalated) is a superconductor.</li>
    <li>Fullerene is soluble in many organic solvents such as toluene, benzene, chloroform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Applications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used in preparation of superconductors, electronic devices; used in batteries as charge carrier.</li>
    <li>C60F60 fully fluorinated fullerene is known as the teflon ball which is a best lubricant.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="graphite-structure">
  <h2>Graphite: structure and properties</h2>
  <p>The structure of graphite consists of layer hexagonal arranged C atoms; within the layer each C atom is bonded to three neighbouring atoms by covalent bonds; the C–C bond distance is 1.40 Å and distance between layers is ~3.42 Å; hybridisation is sp² because each C atom is combined to 3 carbon atoms and 4th valency of C is unsatisfied; these π electrons are mobile throughout the structure and contribute to electrical conductivity; density of graphite is ~2.25 g/cm³ and melting point is high.</p>

  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Composed of layers hexagons; each carbon bonded to three neighbours.</li>
    <li>C–C covalent distance ≈ 1.4 Å; interlayer distance ≈ 3.42 Å.</li>
    <li>sp² hybridisation; 4th valency contributes to conductivity.</li>
    <li>Density ≈ 2.25 g/cm³; high melting point.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Uses of graphite</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It is soft to touch so it can be used for lubricants.</li>
    <li>It is used in lead pencils.</li>
    <li>It is used for making electrodes in dry cells.</li>
    <li>It is used for making crucibles.</li>

  <h2>Titration indicators (from previous page)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Why do we use two different types of indicators in the titration? — One indicator used for carbonate and the other is used for bicarbonates.</li>
    <li>Why alkalinity of water cannot be due to the simultaneous presence of OH⁻, CO₃²⁻ and HCO₃⁻, give reasons. — The possibility of OH⁻ and HCO₃⁻ ions together is ruled out because they combine instantaneously to form CO₃²⁻ ions. Thus OH⁻ and HCO₃⁻ ion cannot exist together in water and hence can be concluded that all the three OH⁻, HCO₃⁻, CO₃²⁻ ions cannot exist together.</li>
